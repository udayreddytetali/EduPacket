// createAdmin.js (retired)
// This helper script was used during development to create an initial admin user.
// Per repository cleanup, this file has been retired to avoid accidental execution.
// If you need to create an admin user, use the application's admin UI or
// run a controlled one-off script in a secure environment.

// No runtime code below - file intentionally left as a stub.
